            <h3> Dear Trisha, </h3>
            <h4> Happy 8th Anniversaryyy, bff!! I miss you so much Àô‚ó†Àô<br>
                IDK what to give to uu, since hindi tayo magkikita. Sooo, I made this website for youuu.<br>
                Also, a letter na hindi na mawawala at masusunog hehe. <br> <br>
                First of all, I wanted to start this letter by thanking you! <br>
                Thank you for staying by my side, and for always listening to all my rants hehe(‡∑ÜÀô·µïÀô‡∑Ü)‚ô° <br>
                And also for always reaching out. Alam ko kung gano ka kabusy since nung nagstart ka na magwork but u still make time na magreach out sa akin huhu <br>
                I appreciate you, so muchhh ‚∏ú(ÔΩ°ÀÉ ·µï ÀÇ )‚∏ù‚ô° <br>
                And I want you to know na I‚Äôm sooo proud of you. so much proud! <br>
                you're one of the strongest, hardworking, selfless, and bravest person that I know.<br>
                I saw your struggles, and your efforts - that made me admire you so much <br>
                so, if u need someone to tell your worries, your burden, or anything <br>
                andito lang ako makikinig, through ups and down. Andito ako palagi <br>
                but if hindi mo kayang magsabi sa akin, always remember na let go of the things that feels heavy for you <br>
                It's okay to take a rest, and not worry about things. Don't be sorry din for the things na hindi mo kasalanan.<br>
                Always do the things that will make you happy and free! <br>
                Lagi lang ako andito para suportahan ka hehe <br>

                I LOVE YOU SO MUCH MY PERSON ‚ô° <br> <br>
                You might be wondering kung bakit dorothea yung song hehe <br>
                well.., I know this song is abt losing a contact with a long time friend which is hindi naman tayo but yung line na <br>
                "And if you're ever tired of being known for who you know" <br>
                "you know you'll always know me" <br>
                tells me na kahit sobrang layo na natin, andito pa rin tayo para sa isa't isa <br>
                and If ever na we need someone we know we can always go back to each other. <br>
                At kahit saan man tayo makarating, I will always keep on thinking about you <br>
                kinukwento ko rin u sa other friends ko hehe <br> <br>
                still can't believe na aabot tayo nang ganito katagal 0‚©ä0 <br>
                If gusto mo tumawa at balikan ang highschool days natin, I'm only one call away! tho hindi ko nasagot yung last time hehe <br>
                but still, I'm here lang for youu, always. <br> <br>
                kahit ilang friends pa ang dumating sa akin, ikaw pa rin ang number one ko (nHAKS)<br>
                but I can tell na, ikaw ang bestfriend ng inner child ko (À∂·µî ·µï ·µîÀ∂) <br>
                AAAAA I MISS YOU SO MUUUUUCH mwa mwaaaa <br>
                I LOVE YOU SO MUCH ASHIRT, MY BFF, MY PERSON, MY LOVE ‚ù§Ô∏è <br>
